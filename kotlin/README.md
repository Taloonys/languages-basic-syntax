# General
* Instead of true compiling it uses `JIT` 

## Kotlin
* `Multiparadigm`
* bold compile -> `kotlinc`
    * run -> `java`
* Kotlin is `incredibly rich` on features language, a lot came from both Haskell and Python. 
    * I described a few contents... it's kinda huge

## Java
* `Fully OOP`, no procedure, every single method or class param should be marked personally (public and etc)
* Better to get through this: https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/java/
    * To be honest, it's one of the most boring languages and means nothing special even with Spring, so i abort the idea of even touching it **right now**.
* bold compile -> `javac`
    * run -> `java`

# Tools context
* JDK - Java Development Kit
* JRE - Java Runtime Environment (Like CRTP and etc, minimal tools for build java code)
* JVM - Java Virtual Machine
    * both uses JVM

# Building
* Maven - automatic build system - `pom.xml` is a file targeted by maven system
* Gradle - new automatic build system

* Both works with either Java and Kotlin

# Notes
* I won't use build systems here, cuz they spawn a lot of project important files... so **it's a note repo, not a project**
