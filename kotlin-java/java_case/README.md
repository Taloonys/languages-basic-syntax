# General
* Instead of true compiling it uses `JIT` 
* `Fully OOP`, no procedure, every single method or class param should be marked personally (public and etc)
* Increadibly weak and simple for C-like syntax family
* Better to get through this: https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/java/

# Tools context
* JDK - Java Development Kit
* JRE - Java Runtime Environment (Like CRTP and etc, minimal tools for build java code)
* JVM - Java Virtual Machine

# Building
* Maven - automatic build system - `pom.xml` is a file targeted by maven system
* Gradle - new automatic build system
    * Both works with either Java and Kotlin

# Notes
To be honest, it's one of the most boring languages and means nothing special even with Spring, so i abort the idea of even touching it **right now**.
