# languages-basic-syntax
Own stuff for fast "mental" switch between languages concepts and syntax.

- Python  -> `jupyter format`
- C++     -> `in heart`
- Kotlin  -> future plan
- Haskell -> in process..
- Golang  -> `just code`
- Rust    -> future plan

future plan: `decompose jupyter files into basic abstract themes for better navigation through github files`
