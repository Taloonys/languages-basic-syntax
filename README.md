# languages-basic-syntax
Own stuff for fast "mental" switch between languages concepts and syntax.

- Python  -> `jupyter format`
- C++     -> `in heart`
- Jave    -> low chance
- Kotlin  -> closest target...
- Haskell -> `jupyter format` + skipped some info, cuz it's an overdo for just concepts learning
- Golang  -> `just code`
- Rust    -> future plan

future plan: `decompose jupyter files into basic abstract themes for better navigation through github files`
